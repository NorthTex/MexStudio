# MexStudio

A **Fork** of **[TeXStudio]** from the *18th October 2021*,<br>
aiming to make the project maintainable.

For info on how to use **MexStudio**, please check the<br>
parent repo, as **MexStudio** won't yet differ in<br>
any functionality.

# Goal

Slowly updating the existing codebase to a modern<br>
C++ standard while not adding more new features.

# Notes

**MexStudio** as in `Maintainable TeXStudio`

**MexStudio** is not using **Githubs** forking<br>
system as this project is not aimed to ever merge<br>
with it's parent project for new features again,<br>
but rather, for now, focus soley on updating<br>
the existing code and at some point establish<br>
it's own unique features if seen useful.

**MexStudio** is not in any rush, the codebase<br>
is big, a `Great Monolith` as one may say, there<br>
is lot's to be done, this will take a while~
