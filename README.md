# MexStudio

A [Fork of TeXStudio] from the *18th October 2021*,<br>
aiming to make the project maintainable.

For info on how to use **MexStudio**, please check the<br>
parent repo, as **MexStudio** won't yet differ in<br>
any functionality.

# Goal

Slowly updating the existing codebase to a modern
C++ standard while not adding more new features.

# Notes

**MexStudio** as in `Maintainable TeXStudio`

**MexStudio** is not using **Githubs** forking
system as this project is not aimed to ever merge
with it's parent project for new features again,
but rather, for now, focus soley on updating
the existing code and at some point establish
it's own unique features if seen useful.

**MexStudio** is not in any rush, the codebase
is big, a `Great Monolith` as one may say, there
is lot's to be done, this will take a while~
